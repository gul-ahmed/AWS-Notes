# AWS INTRODUCTION

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely used cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.com. Launched in 2006, AWS offers a broad set of scalable and cost-effective cloud services, allowing businesses, organizations, and individuals to build and deploy applications and services with ease. AWS is a pioneer in cloud computing and has played a significant role in shaping the landscape of the industry.


# AWS Global Infrastructure

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has built a global infrastructure that is designed to provide reliable, scalable, and low-latency cloud services to users around the world. 

This infrastructure consists of a network of data centers strategically located in different geographic regions, each containing multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

AWS's global infrastructure aims to provide consistent and reliable services to users worldwide. Organizations can deploy resources in the region that best meets their performance, regulatory, and data residency requirements.

**Regions:**

- AWS has established physical locations around the world called "Regions." Each region is a separate geographic area with multiple Availability Zones.


**Availability Zones (AZs):**

- Each AWS Region is divided into multiple isolated Availability Zones, which are essentially separate data centers within the region.
- Availability Zones are designed to provide redundancy and fault tolerance. They are interconnected through high-speed, low-latency networks.


**Edge Locations:**

- AWS has a global network of Edge Locations that are used by the Content Delivery Network (CDN) service, Amazon CloudFront. 
- These Edge Locations are located in cities worldwide and are used to cache and deliver content to end-users with low latency.


**Global Accelerator:**

- AWS Global Accelerator is a service that uses Anycast to route traffic over the AWS global network to the optimal AWS endpoint based on health, geography, and routing policies.
- It helps improve the availability and performance of applications by utilizing the AWS global network infrastructure.


**Wavelength Zones:**

- In collaboration with telecommunication providers, AWS has introduced Wavelength Zones that bring AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks. This allows for ultra-low latency applications, such as augmented reality and virtual reality.
